# Silent Failure in R Data Frame Subsetting

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic issue in R: the silent failure when subsetting data frames using character vectors of column names that include missing columns.  The code runs without throwing an error, which can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug issues.

## The Bug
The `bug.R` file contains code that attempts to subset a data frame. If the specified column names don't all exist, there's no error message, and the result is a data frame with fewer columns than expected.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.R` file provides a corrected version using more robust subsetting techniques to handle cases where some specified columns may be missing.  This ensures more reliable and predictable behavior.
